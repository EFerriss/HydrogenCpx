FTIR spectra, baselines, peakfits, and python code for a project measuring hydrogen diffusion in clinopyroxene. The accompanying academic journal article has been accepted to *Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology*. DOI: 10.1007/s00410-016-1262-8.

Note that these codes were written in python 2.7 using an earlier version of pynams (v0.1.0). The latest version of pynams along with working examples can be found in the [pynams github repository](http://github.com/EFerriss/pynams).
