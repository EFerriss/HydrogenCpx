FTIR spectra, baselines, peakfits, and python code for a project measuring hydrogen diffusion in clinopyroxene. The accompanying academic journal article was submitted to *Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology* in November, 2015.

All spectra filenames and position data are in cpx_spectra.py, and the remaining files were used to generate the figures for the manuscript.
